# PersonalWeb
I think that everyone needs a website, a personal brand; so why not start one. This will be my personal website.


I'm not a developer by any means, I just like it and I'm experimenting. Most likely, the page is not of incredible quality, although it will be enough.


For the color palette I have used 4 different shades:
Number of compounds: 4

    Green tones
    {
      Viridian Green
      {
        HEX: 2f9c95
        RGB: 47, 156, 149
        HSB: 176, 70, 61

        HUE: 1
      }
    }

    Brown tones
    {
      Dust
      {
        HEX: a44200
        RGB: 164, 66, 0
        HSB: 24, 100, 64

        HUE: 1
      }
    } 
      Beige
      {
        HEX: ebebd3
        RGB: 235, 235, 211
        HSB: 60, 10, 92

        HUE: 1
      }

      Orange Yellow Crayola
      {
        HEX: f4d35e
        RGB: 244, 211, 94
        HSB: 47, 61, 96

        HUE: 1
      }
    }
For more information visit the pallete folder.



The application is divided into different folders for easy maintenance. The "Style" folder is in charge of the style of the page using CSS, the "Images" folder is where all the images that will be used on the web are located. In the "Pallete" folder, as I mentioned before, we find all the information about the colors.

     >>>Images = images of the page are stored here
     >>>Pallete = pallete information
     >>>Style = CSS files for the pag

In addition, we find in the root directory other files such as the index.html itself
