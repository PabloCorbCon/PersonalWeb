# PersonalWeb
I think that everyone needs a website, a personal brand; so why not start one. This will be my personal website.


I'm not a developer by any means, I just like it and I'm experimenting. Most likely, the page is not of incredible quality, although it will be enough.


For the color palette I have used 5 different shades:
  Tea Green (DEEFB7)  
  
  Celadon (98DFAF)
  
  Keppel (5FB49C)
  
  Space cadet (273043)
  
  Bistre (2E1E0F)
  
All the information regarding the color palette used on this web page is in the "pallete" repository folder.


The application is divided into different folders for easy maintenance. The "Style" folder is in charge of the style of the page using CSS, the "Images" folder is where all the images that will be used on the web are located. In the "Pallete" folder, as I mentioned before, we find all the information about the colors.


In addition, we find in the root directory other files such as the index.html itself
